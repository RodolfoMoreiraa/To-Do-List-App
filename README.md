# to_do_list_app

. This was my First flutter aplication, it consists in a simple but efficient and aesthetic To-Do-list App made with Flutter and FireBase as Backend.
. The app contains a login system connected to Firebase and a main page to add the tasks we want to do in our day.
. All the tasks are connected to firebase and we can create, update, and delete the tasks, and when we finish the task we mark the checkbox.
. It was an app that i really liked to do and learned a lot about flutter and android development.
